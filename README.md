# Solution to Advent of Code 2022 in F#
I originally started solving them in F# in 2022, but due to a release of the software I was working on at the time, I ended up not having time for it. I picked it back up and finished in 2024.

To run the puzzles simply put the corresponding input into the same folder with the name "dayX.txt" where X is the day.
